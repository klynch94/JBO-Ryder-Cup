                <div class="bio">Hailing from beautiful Buffalo Grove on the northside of Chicago, you can find Matthew at his local fishing hole or playing Spikeball with his fiance. When he is not breaking a sweat tossing the iron around, you can catch him talking insurance and making America insured again. </div>

                </div>
                <div class="bio">Coming in from Aurora, Illinois, Zachary is another 'iron junkie' that loves his BCAAs and NAACPs. He was part of the first graduating class out of Nequa Valley High School and still gives his appreciation by stopping in each week to give thanks to his favorite teachers. If you get in a car accident, not to worry - working at a non-profit human transplant company, Zach will suit you up quickly with a new femur in no time.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="bio">Jason grew up in Elmhurst, Illinois, which is 'about 20 minutes from the city with no traffic'. Home to country singer Brett Eldrege throughout his college years, he was quickly inspired to pursue his life long dream of working for a national nuts and bolts distributor within the Chicago area. Known as 'fairway ray', TPC Deere Run have been warned to keep them in top shape for the upcoming tournament.</div>

                <div class="bio">All the way from the United Kingdom, it is only fitting that Kieran would be the team captain for team Europe during this event. As an aspiring country boy with a desire to mow lawns for a living, he sure loves to tip 'em on back and slice every ball off the tee box.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="bio">Growing up in Jefferson Park, Chicago, Eric has always pinned himself as a city cat. He has made a living out of telling old people what to do with their money and doesn't plan to stop any time soon. In 2013 he could have played for the Chicago Blackhawks but he quickly found himself back at home living with his parents.</div>

                <div class="bio">Coming in from Chicago's finest suburb, Dunning, Illinois, Steven joins us as our most experienced golfer. When he is not watching YouTube videos of golf swings under his bed covers, you can find him on the couch watching more YouTube videos of golf swings. Living off of Vitamin Water, look for Steven to be amped up on the first tee during this upcoming tournament.</div>
