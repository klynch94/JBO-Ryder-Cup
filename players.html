                <h5 class="names">Matthew Zabrin</h5>
                <div class="bio">Hailing from beautiful Buffalo Grove on the northside of Chicago, you can find Matthew at his local fishing hole, playing fetch with his puppy, Hank, or wrestling with his fiance. When he is not breaking a sweat tossing the iron around, you can catch him talking insurance and making America insured again. </div>

                </div>
                <div class="bio">Coming in from Aurora, Illinois, Zachary is another 'iron junkie' that loves his BCAAs and NCAAs. His favorite pastimes include talking to his Google Home, Xbox One S, and polishing his high school volleyball trophies. If you get in a car accident, not to worry - well connected in the midwest Human Donor network, Zach will suit you up with a new femur in no time.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="bio">Jason grew up in Elmhurst, Illinois, which is 'about 20 minutes from the city with no traffic'. Growing up in America's most blue collar town, he was inspired to pursue his life long dream of working for a national nuts and bolts distributor within the Chicago area. Unlike Matthew, he is not a good fisherman as he is always dropping the bass. Known as 'fairway ray', TPC Deere Run have been warned to keep them in top shape for the upcoming tournament.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="bio">All the way from the United Kingdom, it is only fitting that Kieran would be the team captain for team Europe during this event. As a self-proclaimed country boy with a desire to mow lawns for a living, he sure loves to tip 'em on back and slice every ball off the tee box.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="bio">Growing up in Jefferson Park, Chicago, Eric adds new meaning to 'made in the USA'. Giving up his dream to play on the 2013 Chicago Blackhawks, Eric decided to pursue a career telling baby boomers what to do with their money. His perfect day would include catching Tom Skilling's morning report, sitting backed up on the Dan Ryan, and a quick round with friend Rahm Emanuel in the afternoon.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="bio">Coming in from Chicago's finest suburb, Dunning, Illinois, Steven is no stranger to golf. When he is not watching YouTube videos of golf swings under his bed covers, you can find him on the couch watching more YouTube videos of golf swings. Thanks to his success in the accounting industry, Steven has been able to build an impressive collection of sketchers and live solely off of Vitamin Water and Hot Cheetos.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="bio">Chase joins the JBO Ryder Cup this year as the pride and joy of Missoura. Known as the handicapped Phil Mickleson, Chase actually pays for his own sponsors, Kith and Yeezy, to be on his bag for his events. Growing up in the sticks with racoons and coyotes, you know all of his jeans are ripped. Besides having the best dressed bag on tour, Chase's claim to fame is finishing 8th in the 2013 NCAA division 6 college soccer playoffs. </div>

                    <h5 class="names">Trace Linhart</h5>
                </div>
                <div class="bio">Hailing from the Hersey capital of the world, Trace finds himself carrying the most expensive bag in the group. When he is not running miles and making dials, you can catch him on Big Brother living in his glass house. By always keeping his options open, Trace is old enough to qualify for the senior tour and young enough to qualify for the senior prom. Being a sales chameleon and full of versatility, don't be surprised to see a hockey stick from the tee box or a sauce pass out of the sand from this ol' man. </div>
